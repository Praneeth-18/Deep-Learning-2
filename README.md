# Project Overview


## Basic Tokenization on the Input Data

The initial part of the project explores basic tokenization techniques. It demonstrates how to break down text into manageable tokens. This section provides a foundation for understanding how language models perceive and process input data.

## Using OpenAI API

This section delves into leveraging the OpenAI API, particularly focusing on GPT models for generating human-like text. It includes examples of setting up the API, crafting prompts and interpreting the model's responses. The use of the OpenAI API exemplifies how to incorporate powerful language models into applications.

## Creating a Code Interpreter with Function Calling

Focusing on the automation of code execution, this part introduces a method for creating a code interpreter. It showcases how to dynamically execute Python functions based on input data, simulating a basic interpreter environment. This functionality is pivotal in applications requiring runtime code evaluation and dynamic response generation.

## Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

Retrieval Augmented Generation combines the generative capabilities of language models with the retrieval of external knowledge. This part demonstrates enhancing response generation with additional context from external sources, improving the model's accuracy and relevance in answering queries.

## Fine-tuning Models

This section covers the fine-tuning of pre-trained models on specific datasets to tailor their performance to particular tasks or domains. It illustrates the process of adjusting model parameters for optimal results on custom data, highlighting the adaptability of pre-trained models to new challenges.


# LLaMA Python Integration Example

This example showcases the use of the `llama-cpp-python` package to integrate the LLaMA (Large Language Model) with Python applications. It demonstrates how to load a pre-trained LLaMA model and generate text responses for a broad range of applications, making it a versatile tool for various tasks.

## Installation

This requires the installation of the `llama-cpp-python` package. Ensure Python is installed on your system before proceeding with the package installation.

## Setup

You will need a pre-trained LLaMA model. After obtaining the model, update the script to point to the model's file path. This step is crucial for the script to function correctly.

## Usage

The script is designed to be adaptable for multiple uses, including but not limited to:

- Language Translation
- Content Creation and Summarization
- Educational Tutorials and Explanations

We can also implement the following 

- Code Generation and Debugging
- Interactive Storytelling
- Mental Health Support

By customizing the prompts, you can tailor the model's output to fit your specific needs across these varied applications.

## Extending the Model's Capabilities

The integration offers the flexibility to be extended further. It can be connected with web APIs, databases, or other software applications for dynamic interactions, broadening its utility across different domains.


## Installation

Instructions for installing necessary libraries and setting up the environment are provided within the project, ensuring users can easily replicate and build upon the provided examples.
